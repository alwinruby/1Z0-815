**Exception handling** - allows developers to easily detect errors without writing special code to test return values.  Better, it lets us handle these errors in code that is nicely separated from the code that generated them and handle an entire class of errors with the same code, and it allows us to let a method defer handling its errors to a previously called method.  Exception handling works by transferring of a program to an exception handler when an error, or exception, occurs.


**Extensibility** -  a term that describes a design or code that can easily be enhanced without being rewritten.
