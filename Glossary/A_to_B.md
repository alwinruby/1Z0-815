# A to B


**Abstract class** - a type of class that is not allowed to be instantiated.  The only reason it exists is to be extended.  Abstract classes contain methods and variables common to all the subclasses, but the class itself is of a type that will not be used directly.  Even a single abstract method requires that a class be marked _abstract_.


**Abstract method** - a method declaration that contains no functional code. The reason for using an abstract method is to ensure that subclasses of this class will include an implementation of this method.  Any concrete class (that is, a class that is not abstract, and therefore capable of being instantiated) must implement all abstract methods it has inherited.


**Access modifier** - a modifier that changes the visibility of a class or member of a class (method, variable, or nested class).


**Anonymous inner classes** - local inner classes that do not have a class name.  You create an anonymous inner class by creating an instance of a new unnamed class that is either a subclass of a named class type or an implementer a named interface type.


**API** - Application programmers interface.  This term refers to a set of related classes and methods that work together to provide a particular capability.  The API represents  the part of a class that are exposed (although access controls) to code written by others.


**Array** - homogenous data structure implemented in Java as objects.  Arrays store one or more of a specific type and provide indexed access to the store.


 **Automatic variables** - Also called method local or stock variables.  Automatic variables that are declared within a method and discarded when the method has completed.
